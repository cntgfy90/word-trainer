This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project is called Word-trainer. It's created as a game that helps you to test your typing skills. It's not the last variant and it might improve later.

The technologies used while creating the project:
1. create-react-app by Facebook
2. React (Redux in future)
3. HTML + CSS
